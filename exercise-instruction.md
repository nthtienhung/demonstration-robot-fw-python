SDET Technical Exercise

Objective:
Create a project that demonstrates your skills in automation testing using the following technologies to create UI web or app automation, or any custom tools:

Robot Framework
Python
Instructions:

Choose any publicly available website or mobile app that you will use to design your automation tests or develop custom tools. You are free to select any platform that aligns with your interest or expertise.
If you identify any gaps in available testing tools or functionality, it is advantageous to create your own custom tools to address these gaps. This demonstrates your ability to innovate and extend existing automation frameworks.
If possible, integrate AI-based tools or languages for enhancing your test scenarios, such as visual validation, natural language processing for test case generation, or any other creative AI use case.
The project should showcase how you structure and organize your code for maintainability, scalability, and reusability.
Commit your project to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and include a README file with clear instructions on how to set up and execute the tests. 
Requirements:

Project Structure: Your code should be well-organized, modular, and adhere to best practices for naming conventions, code structure, and separation of concerns.
Test Design: Provide clear and effective test scenarios. We expect you to write tests that demonstrate your technical skills in automation, with appropriate assertions, error-handling, and edge cases.
Automation Framework: Ensure that you use Robot Framework effectively for test automation. 
Custom Libraries: If you create any custom libraries or reusable components to support your tests, ensure they are well-documented.
Evaluation Criteria:

Code Quality: We will assess the cleanliness, maintainability, and modularity of your code.
Creativity: We will favor innovative approaches, particularly those that leverage AI or custom tools to improve the testing process.
Structure and Design: The way you structure your tests, framework, and overall project will play a key role in our evaluation.
